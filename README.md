# FiveM as a Service

This is a simple project for running your Fivem server as an Windows Service.

## Why would I want to do that?

Well, running your server as an service would mean that its all running in the
background, you would no longer have to be afraid of accidentally closing the
Terminal window running your server.

It would also allow for the server to automatically be started upon startup, and
automatically restarted if stopped, and so on.

## How do I use it?

Either you can download the source and build it yourself, or you can download
the prebuilt binaries on our
[release page](https://github.com/Z3rio/fivem-as-service/releases) and run it
from there

## How do I configure it?

Just configure the `appsettings.json` file correctly and it should all run
smoothly, if it doesnt, then please open a
